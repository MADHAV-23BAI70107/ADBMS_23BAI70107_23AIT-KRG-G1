Problem Title: Author-Book Relationship Using Joins and Basic SQL Operations
Procedure (Step-by-Step):
Design two tables — one for storing author details and the other for book details.

Ensure a foreign key relationship from the book to its respective author.

Insert at least three records in each table.

Perform an INNER JOIN to link each book with its author using the common author ID.

Select the book title, author name, and author’s country.

Sample Output Description:

When the join is performed, we get a list where each book title is shown along 
with its author’s name and their country.

/*
Problem Title: Department-Course Subquery and Access Control
Procedure (Step-by-Step):

Design normalized tables for departments and the courses they offer, maintaining a foreign key relationship.

Insert five departments and at least ten courses across those departments.

Use a subquery to count the number of courses under each department.

Filter and retrieve only those departments that offer more than two courses.

Grant SELECT-only access on the courses table to a specific user.

Sample Output Description:

The result shows the names of departments which are associated with more than two courses in the system.
